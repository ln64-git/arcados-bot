# Incremental Database Sync with User History Tracking

## Overview

This document describes the intelligent incremental sync system that replaces the full sync-on-startup approach with a smart, efficient sync that only processes changes.

## Key Features

### 1. Incremental Sync Strategy

- **First Run**: Performs full sync of all Discord data (guilds, channels, roles, members)
- **Subsequent Runs**: Only syncs differences:
  - New entities (channels, roles, members added since last sync)
  - Modified entities (profile changes detected via hashing)
  - Orphaned entities (marked as inactive if removed from Discord)

### 2. Comprehensive User Profile Tracking

The system tracks ALL Discord user properties dynamically, storing complete profile history:

**Tracked Properties:**

- `username` - Discord username
- `display_name` - Display name in guild
- `global_name` - Global display name
- `avatar` - Avatar hash
- `avatar_decoration` - Avatar decoration data
- `banner` - Profile banner
- `accent_color` - Profile accent color
- `discriminator` - Legacy discriminator
- `bio` - User bio/about me
- `flags` - User flags
- `premium_type` - Nitro subscription type
- `public_flags` - Public user flags
- `nickname` - Guild-specific nickname

**Profile History Format:**

```typescript
{
  changed_fields: {
    username: { old: "OldName", new: "NewName" },
    avatar: { old: "hash1", new: "hash2" }
  },
  profile_hash: "new_hash_after_changes",
  changed_at: "2025-10-17T..."
}
```

Only changed fields are stored, creating differential snapshots that preserve complete history while minimizing storage.

### 3. Sync Metadata Tracking

New `sync_metadata` table tracks sync state per guild and entity type:

- `last_full_sync` - Timestamp of last full sync
- `last_check` - Timestamp of last incremental check
- `entity_count` - Count of entities in last sync
- `status` - "healthy", "needs_healing", or "syncing"

### 4. Health Detection & Auto-Healing

The system automatically detects data integrity issues:

- Compares database counts with Discord counts
- If discrepancy >10%, marks status as "needs_healing"
- Next startup will perform full sync to restore integrity
- Full sync also triggered if >7 days since last full sync

### 5. Profile Change Detection

Uses content hashing to efficiently detect profile changes:

- Generates hash of all profile fields (excludes roles and timestamps)
- Compares hash with database to detect ANY profile change
- Only queries database for existing members
- Logs detailed change summaries for debugging

## Architecture

### New Files Created

1. **`src/features/discord-sync/SyncStateManager.ts`**

   - Manages sync metadata operations
   - Determines if full sync or incremental sync needed
   - Tracks sync health and completion

2. **`src/features/discord-sync/UserHistoryTracker.ts`**
   - Compares Discord profiles with database profiles
   - Detects changes across all profile fields
   - Creates differential history entries
   - Generates human-readable change summaries

### Modified Files

1. **`src/database/schema.ts`**

   - Added `sync_metadata` table definition
   - Extended `members` table with all Discord user properties
   - Added `profile_hash` and `profile_history` fields
   - Added `SyncMetadata` and `ProfileHistoryEntry` interfaces
   - Implemented `generateProfileHash()` helper function

2. **`src/database/SurrealDBManager.ts`**

   - Added `getSyncMetadata()` - Get sync state
   - Added `upsertSyncMetadata()` - Update sync state
   - Added `getEntityIds()` - Get all IDs for comparison
   - Added `getMember()` - Get single member for comparison
   - Added `bulkMarkInactive()` - Bulk cleanup orphaned entities
   - Added `getEntityCounts()` - Health check queries

3. **`src/features/discord-sync/DiscordSyncManager.ts`**
   - Replaced `performInitialSync()` with `performStartupSync()`
   - Added `performFullGuildSync()` - Full sync when needed
   - Added `performIncrementalGuildSync()` - Smart differential sync
   - Added `syncEntityType()` - Generic incremental sync for channels/roles
   - Added `syncMembersIncrementally()` - Member sync with profile tracking
   - Added `syncMemberWithHistory()` - Individual member sync with history
   - Added `detectHealthIssues()` - Automatic health monitoring
   - Updated event handlers to use `syncMemberWithHistory()`

## Sync Flow

### Startup Sync

```
1. Check sync metadata for each guild
2. If needs full sync (first run, >7 days, or healing):
   â†’ Perform full sync
   â†’ Record all entities
   â†’ Mark sync as complete with timestamp
3. Else:
   â†’ Perform incremental sync
   â†’ Compare DB IDs vs Discord IDs
   â†’ Sync missing entities
   â†’ Check existing members for profile changes
   â†’ Mark orphaned entities as inactive
   â†’ Run health check
```

### Real-time Updates

```
1. Discord event fires (memberUpdate, channelCreate, etc.)
2. For member events:
   â†’ Get existing member from DB
   â†’ Compare profiles using UserHistoryTracker
   â†’ If changed:
     â€¢ Generate history entry with changes
     â€¢ Append to profile_history array
     â€¢ Update member record
   â†’ If unchanged:
     â€¢ Only update roles and timestamps
3. For other entities:
   â†’ Direct upsert to database
```

## Performance Benefits

- **Fast Startup**: Typical incremental sync takes <1 second vs 10-30 seconds for full sync
- **Efficient Storage**: Differential history only stores what changed
- **Smart Healing**: Automatically detects and fixes data inconsistencies
- **Scalable**: Member sync can handle large guilds without fetching all members every time
- **Resilient**: Falls back to full sync when integrity issues detected

## Configuration

The sync system uses these thresholds (configurable in code):

- **Full Sync Threshold**: 7 days (in `SyncStateManager.FULL_SYNC_THRESHOLD_DAYS`)
- **Health Check Threshold**: 10% discrepancy (in `DiscordSyncManager.detectHealthIssues()`)
- **History Limit**: 100 entries per member (in `UserHistoryTracker.createUpdatedMember()`)

## Monitoring

Sync operations log detailed information:

- `ðŸ”¹ Performing full sync for guild: ...` - Full sync initiated
- `ðŸ”¹ Performing incremental sync for guild: ...` - Incremental sync initiated
- `ðŸ”¹ Sync completed in Xs: Y new, Z updated, W marked inactive` - Sync summary
- `ðŸ”¹ Updated member X: Changed N field(s): ...` - Profile change detected
- `ðŸ”¸ Health issue detected for ... : DB has X, Discord has Y` - Data inconsistency found

## Example Output

```
ðŸ”¹ Starting startup sync check...
ðŸ”¹ Performing incremental sync for guild: the hearth
ðŸ”¹ Updated member JohnDoe: Changed 2 field(s): username: "john_doe" â†’ "JohnDoe", avatar: "abc123" â†’ "def456"
ðŸ”¹ Sync completed in 0.85s: 5 new, 12 updated, 3 marked inactive
```

## Database Schema

### sync_metadata Table

```sql
DEFINE TABLE sync_metadata SCHEMAFULL {
  id: string,                    -- "guildId:entityType"
  guild_id: string,
  entity_type: string,           -- "guild" | "channel" | "role" | "member"
  last_full_sync: datetime?,
  last_check: datetime,
  entity_count: number,
  status: string,                -- "healthy" | "needs_healing" | "syncing"
  created_at: datetime,
  updated_at: datetime
};
```

### members Table (Updated)

```sql
DEFINE TABLE members SCHEMAFULL {
  id: string,
  guild_id: string,
  user_id: string,

  -- Current profile state (all Discord properties)
  username: string,
  display_name: string,
  global_name: string?,
  avatar: string?,
  avatar_decoration: string?,
  banner: string?,
  accent_color: number?,
  discriminator: string,
  bio: string?,
  flags: number?,
  premium_type: number?,
  public_flags: number?,

  -- Guild-specific data
  nickname: string?,
  joined_at: datetime,
  roles: array<string>,

  -- Change tracking
  profile_hash: string,
  profile_history: array<object> DEFAULT [],

  created_at: datetime,
  updated_at: datetime,
  active: bool DEFAULT true
};
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the sync system:

1. **Batch member updates**: Update multiple members in single query
2. **Configurable history limits**: Per-guild settings for history retention
3. **Profile change webhooks**: Notify external systems of profile changes
4. **Sync analytics**: Track sync performance and patterns over time
5. **Manual sync triggers**: Admin command to force full sync
6. **Partial member sync**: Only sync members who were active recently for very large guilds
